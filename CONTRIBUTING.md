# Issues and Bugs

For reporting an issue, please include:
 - your Python and dependency versions
 - your OS platform
 - any error messages or output
 - a minimal reproduction, not dependent on your Snowflake account or data
 - any modifications you have made to the code

# Enhancements

Enhancement requests may be considered, if practical - the project is highly dependent on the model output from the Catboost project. Your enhancement request may be for that project, rather than this one.

Please describe:
 - what the feature you need is
 - the overall goal you are trying to achieve
 - what you have tried so far, and where you were unable to continue
 
 If you've been able to make your enhancement already, please fork this repository, make your changes and submit a pull request along with your issue.
